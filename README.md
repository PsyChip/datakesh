# Datakesh rat

This is my journey on developing datakesh rat between 2002 to 2009, dumped it's sources directly from my harddisk. Variables and folder names are mostly turkish but code is understandable when you see it.

## PSYBUS [2002-2005]
The first iteration, acts as a socket server and accepts incoming text commands. written in rapidQ (https://rapidq.phatcode.net/)

## Yeni nesil bus [2005]
Entirely rewritten version in delphi 6, features reverse connection

## Yeni nesil bus reloaded [2007]
Switched to delphi 7, features FWB++ (firewall bypass) by injecting dll into explorer.exe

## Yeni nesil bus final [2009]
Features socket compression and polymorphic code to bypass AV's. Also it's the publicly released version, did some makeup, created a cool opengl intro with background music and added few sound effects.
